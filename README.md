# Build-an-AI-Investment-Advisor-with-LLM-LangChain

In this project, I built an "stock investment advisor" application, which lets the users experiment with investment strategies and learn how investment in stock market works.

In the ever-evolving world of finance, making informed investment decisions is crucial. Whether you're an aspiring investor or a seasoned trader, having a reliable source of general financial information and insights can give you a significant edge.

In this project, I aimed to build an AI application that goes beyond mere information dissemination. The app will actively analyze market trends using the latest news from sources like Yahoo Finance and Google News. Moreover, it will evaluate financial statements spanning a 2-year period to offer insightful financial analyses. This AI agent using LangChain, a leading package for developing applications based on large language models (LLMs).

A Look at the Project Ahead:

- Build an AI-powered application to help people learn the experiments with stock investment strategies.

- Gain hands-on experience with AI and natural language processing (NLP).

- Access real-time financial news and financial data.

- Understand the LangChain framework, a powerful tool for AI applications.

- Gain better understanding of financial markets.
